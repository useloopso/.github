### Smart contracts
Transfer tokens between Sepolia, Lukso Testnet, and Mumbai by locking them on the source chain, triggering a rapid minting process on the destination chain through a centralized Bridge Messaging Relayer.

#### Core Mechanism
- Users lock tokens on chain A, and a relayer mints corresponding tokens on chain B.
- Applicable to any tokens in both directions.
-  Architecture inspired by Wormhole, prioritizing security.


#### Deployed Chains
- Deployed on Sepolia, Lukso Testnet, and Mumbai.
- Community-selected networks based on this [poll](https://x.com/loopso_xyz/status/1725529010535371236).

#### Example Bridging Process
1. A user initiates the bridging process by calling `bridgeTokens(uint256 _amount, address _to, bytes32 _tokenID)`, specifying the amount, destination address, and the recorded attestation's _tokenID.
2. The bridge deducts the specified token amount from the user's balance.
3. An event `TokensBridged` is emitted, including the transfer ID.
4. The relayer uses the transfer ID to obtain transfer details from the bridge and performs necessary verifications.
5. The relayer calls `releaseWrappedTokens` on Chain B.
6. Chain B mints the specified amount of wrapped tokens and emits an event, notifying the user of the successful bridging process.
7. If the user intends to bridge back, they call `bridgeTokensBack`, burning the specified amount of wrapped tokens.
8. An event `TokensBridgedBack`, similar to `TokensBridged`, is emitted.
9. The relayer picks up the event, calls `releaseTokens` on Chain A, and transfers the specified token amount back to the user.
